dbforms provides a relatively light-weight interface to a database.
It is fairly easy to use, but is limited to fairly straightforward
data-related applications (hence the name).

To add dbforms support to an existing Web Application, 
you must perform the following steps:

- add dbforms_config.xml to WEB-INF, and tailor it for your web app;
- add dbforms_errors.xml to WEB-INF, (may not need tailoring initially);
- add validation.xml to WEB-INF: note that this conflicts with Struts'
  validation.xml, so if you are using both frameworks in the same
  Web Application you'd need either to merge them and hope for the best :-) or
  pick a new name, like dbforms-validation.jar;
- add the dbforms servlet in WEB-INF/web.xml, tailoring the servlet
  for the locations of most of the above files;
- add dbforms.jar to the WEB-INF/lib directory
- add dbforms.tld to WEB-INF (do not modify);
- add log4j.jar, log4j.properties, commons-utils.jar, commons-logging.jar
  to WEB-INF/lib;

Of course, if you are starting afresh, you would probably
begin one of the provided demos, which has all these pieces in place.
