SpringMVC
=========

This is a straightforward "hello form" sample implementation using SpringMVC.

Builds with Eclipse (due to imbedded Spring Jars) and with Maven.

To run it just to "maven package" and drop into any Java Web Container
such as Tomcat, JBoss WildFly (nee JBoss AS).

As per the deisgn goals of this site, this is a truly minimalistic
implementation. There are several places where we don't use
Spring "best practices", e.g., the view resolver config.
There are many good tutorials on the web; here's only one:
