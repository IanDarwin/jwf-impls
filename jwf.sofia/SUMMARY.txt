SOFIA was once among the better of the frameworks I have examined in detail.

It is now considered defunct, since the maintainers abandoned it.

While Sofia took over many duties from the developer, providing
generated "data model" code, it certainly had problems:

	error handling uneven.

	Caches View in session, and Tomcat has persistent sessions,
	so must quit browser to recompile JSP.

	not completely self-contained; requires a 'salmonprops' directory
	(typically outside the web-app) that MUST be specified by abs location
	in -D when starting the app server.

		Should be better to have a per-WEB-INF properties file.
		The files exist but currently MUST be coded in 
		SALMONPROPS dir, NOT in WEB-INF, leading to nuisance
		of hard-coding paths.

		Similarly, must put salmon.jar file into server, e.g.,
		TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib instead of per-webapp.

	Uses these properties to hard-code fonts & colors rather than
	using them to generate a CSS.
