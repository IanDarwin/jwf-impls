SOFIA is one of the best of the frameworks I have examined in detail.

Many good points...

	...

A few minor problems:

	error handling uneven.

	Caches View in session, and Tomcat has persistent sessions,
	so must quit browser to recompile JSP.

	not completely self-contained; requires a 'salmonprops' directory
	(typically outside the web-app) that MUST be specified by abs location
	in -D when starting the app server.

		Should be better to have a per-WEB-INF properties file.
		The files exist but currently MUST be coded in 
		SALMONPROPS dir, NOT in WEB-INF, leading to nuisance
		of hard-coding paths.

		Similarly, must put salmon.jar file into server, e.g.,
		TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib instead of per-webapp.

	Uses these properties to hard-code fonts & colors rather than
	using them to generate a CSS.
